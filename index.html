<h3>Welcome to the Software Revive project!</h3>

<p>The best thing about free software is that it never dies as long as there are people who are interested in its use and development.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, sometimes things go wrong, and many projects get abandoned and dead without any essential reason. So, probably, some help and collaboration efforts are needed to bring software back to life for the benefit of their users. That is what our project for. Here we dig some old sources, applying patches for building the code on modern operating systems and fixing bugs and vulnerabilities, so good old applications have a chance to become useful again this way.</p>
