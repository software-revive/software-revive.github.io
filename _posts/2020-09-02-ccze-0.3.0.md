title:  "CCZE 0.3.0 Phoenix has been released"
---

**Phoenix** rises from the ashes 17 years after the last release. The upstream is dead, but long live CCZE! Most of the work was done 7 years ago, but I was too lazy to make the release. Sorry.

The new maintainer is Vadim Ushakov, and the new site URL is https://github.com/software-revive/ccze-rv.

No new features introduced in this release, but we've achieved significant performance improvements. And also fixed an old segfault.

* The keyword matching algorithm is optimized to avoid lots of redundant `strcmp()`'s.
* Service and protocol names from the `services(5)` database are now cached and looked up in the optimized way. No need to look through the entire database over and over.
* Improvements in interaction with PRCE.
