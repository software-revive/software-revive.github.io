title:  "geh 0.4.0 has been released"
---

There was a report about an abandoned gtk image viewer:

> https://www.linux.org.ru/forum/development/15748300?cid=15885652

The sources were located at:

> https://github.com/4fury/save_them

A directory name inside the archive says it's geh-0.2.0, and the version info
in configure.ac says it's 0.3.0.

So we guess it's 0.3.0, and we bump the version up to 0.4.0 for this release.

* Added new entries to the right-click menu:
  * View -> Full Image Mode, View -> Slide Show Mode, View -> Thumbnail Mode,
    to switch between the view modes with mouse, not just keyboard.
  * Help -> Key Bindings, displays the list of hot keys.
  * Help -> About, displays the detailed info about the application, license
    supported image formats and build environment.
* Added command line options:
  * -v, --version, prints the application version
  * -V, --about, shows the about message (the same as in GUI)
* Added files: AUTHORS, LICENSE, NEWS
* Fixed few compilation warnings.
* The man page removed, since it's short and not helpful.
